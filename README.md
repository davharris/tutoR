# 2-3 examples where scripting saves massive time/effort/errors
  * Scraping data from the web
  * Analyzing multiple data sets the same way
  * Systematic plotting

# Why R?
  * Why not matlab/python/perl/Java/SAS/...?
    * It's what your colleagues use
      * packages to do stuff you want
      * interfaces with everything else
      * share code with colleagues
      * It's free

# Rstudio
  * Where commands go
  * scripts versus interactive use
  * projects

# R language
  * R as a calculator
  * Errors
  * Warnings
  * Assignment ("data can have names")
  * The workspace, ls(), rm()
  * Vectors ("data can be structured", elements can have names)
  * Functions on vectors (mean, sum, var, max)
  * Vector arithmetic
  * Recycling rule
  * Comparison (==, all.equal())
  * Subsetting ("getting data back out")
  * Data frames ("related vectors in table format")
  * Functions on data.frames (e.g. colMeans)
  * Lists
  * [ versus [[ versus $
  * Matrices are not data.frames!
  * Types/classes
  * Floating point
  * NA
  * Loops and *apply
