Talking to R
======================================
incremental:true
type:section

R is like your old graphing calculator
=====================================
incremental:true
## Arithemetic works like you'd expect:

```r
(1 + 1 * 3)^3
```

```
[1] 64
```

## So do lots of basic math functions:

```r
cos(pi)
```

```
[1] -1
```

R is like your old graphing calculator
=====================================
incremental:true

R can also make graphs


```r
plot(function(x) sin(x^2), from = 0, to = 5)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](tutoR-figure/unnamed-chunk-6.png) 

Code can include "comments"
==================================
incremental:true

Anything following "`#`" is ignored through the end of the line.


```r
1+1 # This is a comment.  R ignores it.
```

```
[1] 2
```

```r
2+2 # But tomorrow, it could be helpful
```

```
[1] 4
```


```r
# for understanding the code you
# wrote today.
```

Questions?

Assignment: Data can have names
=====================================
type:section


Referring back to our data
=================================
incremental:true

* Don't always want to type 525600 for number of minutes in a year.
* Want to separate data from code:
  * Insect biomass = fly biomass + beetle biomass + bug biomass
  * Total biomass = fly biomass + beetle biomass + bug biomass + algae biomass
* Only need to update _fly biomass_ once. 

Giving a name to your data
===================================
incremental:true
* `name <- data` &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `name = data`
  * "The container called 'name' gets filled with the data"
  

```r
insect_biomass = 12
area = 50
proportion_ants = .3
```


```r
insect_biomass / area
```

```
[1] 0.24
```

```r
insect_biomass * proportion_ants
```

```
[1] 3.6
```

Questions?
==================
type:prompt

Changing saved values
=======================
incremental:true


```r
x = 2  # Save "2"" with the name "x"
y = x  # save x's current value with the name "y"
```


```r
x = 3  # Change x's value to 3
x
```

```
[1] 3
```

* What's y's value?

```r
y
```

```
[1] 2
```


Keeping track of what you've saved
=============================
incremental:true
* RStudio tells you what you've saved in the upper-right under "Environmentâ†’Global Environment"
* Sometimes also called the "workspace"
* Can also access it with the `ls()` or `objects` commands
* Clear everything out with the broom icon


Using functions
==============================
type:section


Using functions:
=============================
incremental:true

```r
(sin(1) + log(5)) / 3
```

```
[1] 0.817
```

Functions are verbs
========================
incremental:true
"Take this thing and do the function to it"

* Take this cookie and **eat** it
* Take this number and **square** it


```r
cos(pi) # Take pi and *calculate its cosine*
```

```
[1] -1
```


```r
log(area) # Take `area` & *calculate its log*
```

```
[1] 3.912
```

Functions can have modifiers
===============================
incremental:true

* Take this cookie and **eat** it **carefully**


```r
log(area, base = 2) # Take `area` & *calculate its log* *in base 2*
```

```
[1] 5.644
```


```r
rep(5, times = 7) # Take 5 and *repeat* it 7 times*
```

```
[1] 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
```

* Data & modifiers passed to functions are called *arguments*

Anatomy of a function call
===================================
* Name of function (`sin`, `log`, `rep`)
* Parentheses enclosing the arguments
* Arguments, separated by commas

Arguments
==================================

Naming the arguments is (usually) optional:

```r
log(3, 2)
```

```
[1] 1.585
```

```r
log(x = 3, base = 2)
```

```
[1] 1.585
```
***

Some arguments have default values that don't need to be specified: these can
be found on the help pages.

<center>**Questions so far?**</center>

There are tons of functions!
=================================
incremental:true
* You don't need to know all of them
* Most common R usage pattern: use pre-written functions on your custom data
  * do standard actions to your unique stuff
* You can also write your own functions

<Break>
===============================
type:section



Getting help
===============================
type:section

Help files
================================
incremental:true
* `?function_name` or `help(function_name)`

```r
help(rep)
?rep
```

* Some special functions like "+" need to be quoted; quoting never hurts

Parts of a help file
=============================
* **Title:** big picture in big text
* **Description:** summary
* **Usage:** very minimal examples
* **Arguments:** list of ways you can customize the function's action for your needs
* **Details:** Details
* **Value:** What you get out of the function
* **Examples** (consider starting here): ways to use the function

Some help files have a **Note** or **Warning** section for even more information

Help files are annoying
===========================
incremental:true

![](figures/last_resort.png)

***

* Need to know the function name
* Operators and special things need backticks
* Written for programmers, by programmers
* Might need to look in 3-4 different sections.
  * Jump around, focus on **Usage** and **Examples**
* It gets easier

Questions?
======================
type:section

When things go wrong
=====================
incremental:true

* Errors
  * "Something went so badly wrong that I stopped and gave up before I broke something"
  * `1 + "two"`

```
Error in 1 + "two" : non-numeric argument to binary operator
```

***

* Warnings
  * "Something *might* be wrong, but I kept going"
  * `log(-1)`

```
[1] NaN
Warning message:
In log(-1) : NaNs produced
```

When things go wrong
========================
* Bugs:
  * "I told R to do the wrong thing"
  * These are the scariest, because you don't always know your code is wrong.
* [More on errors and warnings](http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/tutorials/impatient-r/#errors)

Data (nouns)
===============
type:section


Vectors
==============
incremental:true
We've already seen *scalars*


```r
area = 50
```


* Data can also form *vectors*

```r
rep(1, times = 5)
```

```
[1] 1 1 1 1 1
```

Making your own vectors
======================
incremental:true

Use the `c` ("combine") function
* Elements have a position and (optionally) names


```r
biomass = c(bugs = 12.1, flies = 23.7, beetles = 3.1)
biomass2 = c(bugs = 7.1, flies = 3.8, beetles = 8.2)
```

* Concatenate vectors with `c` as well.

```r
both_biomass = c(biomass, biomass2)
```

Vectors can hold different kinds of data
===================
* Vectors always belong to *one* "type"
  * **logical**: TRUE or FALSE
  * **integer**: ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, ...
  * **numeric**: 3.141592653589793115998, 2.718281828459045090796
  * **character**: "anything", "3", "Î£Î”Î˜â„¢"
* R "promotes" vectors when concatenated:
  * `c(biomass, "not a number")` is a character vector

<center>**Questions?**</center>

Arithmetic on vectors:
=================================

Arithmetic works element-by-element (based on position, *not* name!)


```r
biomass
```

```
   bugs   flies beetles 
   12.1    23.7     3.1 
```

```r
biomass2
```

```
   bugs   flies beetles 
    7.1     3.8     8.2 
```

```r
biomass + biomass2
```

```
   bugs   flies beetles 
   19.2    27.5    11.3 
```

Shorter vectors are "recycled"
==================================

```r
biomass
```

```
   bugs   flies beetles 
   12.1    23.7     3.1 
```

```r
area
```

```
[1] 50
```

```r
biomass / area
```

```
   bugs   flies beetles 
  0.242   0.474   0.062 
```

Recycling can be dangerous!
====================================

```r
c(10, 20) + c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

```
[1] 11 22 13 24
```


You can also compare vectors
===========================
incremental:true

Greater-than-or-equal (â‰¥, typed as `>=`)

```r
biomass >= biomass2
```

```
   bugs   flies beetles 
   TRUE    TRUE   FALSE 
```

Test for equality with `==`


```r
5 == 5 * 1
```

```
[1] TRUE
```

***

* Be careful about rounding error!

```r
(1.0 - 0.9 - 0.1) == 0
```

```
[1] FALSE
```

* $1.0 - 0.9 - 0.1 = -2.78^{-17}$

* use `all.equal` instead

Getting data out of a vector with [square brackets]
==============================
We want the second element of our vector, which has fly biomass


```
   bugs   flies beetles 
   12.1    23.7     3.1 
```


```r
biomass["flies"]               # By name
biomass[2]                     # By index
biomass[c(-1, -3)]             # Drop negatives
biomass[c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)] # With logic
biomass[biomass > 20]          # With a test
```

Factors
=======================
* Describes **categories** like experimental treatments
  * "Nitrogen addition", "Phosphorous addition",  "Control"


```r
factor(c("Nitrogen addition", "Phosphorous addition",  "Control", "Nitrogen addition"))
```

<center>**Stored internally as 1, 2, 3!**</center>

Questions about vectors?
=========================

Data frames
=======================
incremental:true

Remember `biomass` and `biomass2`?

* What if you have biomasses at 100 sites?


```r
biomass_df = data.frame(
  site = c("site 1", "site 2", "site 3", "site 4", "site 5"), 
  bugs = c(12.1, 7.1, 2.8, 12.5, 3.1), 
  flies = c(23.7, 3.8, 11.3, 32.1, 11.9),
  beetles = c(3.1, 8.2, 17.1, 3.9, 11.7)
)
```

Data frames
==============================

```r
biomass_df = data.frame(
  site = c("site 1", "site 2", "site 3", "site 4", "site 5"), 
  bugs = c(12.1, 7.1, 2.8, 12.5, 3.1), 
  flies = c(23.7, 3.8, 11.3, 32.1, 11.9),
  beetles = c(3.1, 8.2, 17.1, 3.9, 11.7)
)
```

A `data.frame` has one column for each variable, and one row for each replicate.

Each variable is a vector.

Variables can be different types

Can contain missing values (`NA`)

Learning about your objects
==============================


```r
# Structure of object
str(biomass_df) # Rstudio has same info

Subsetting data frames
=========================

```r

```

```
[1] 23.7  3.8 11.3 32.1 11.9
```

```r
# rows 1 and 2, columns "flies" and "beetles"

```

```
  flies beetles
1  23.7     3.1
2   3.8     8.2
```

Subsetting data frames
====================
incremental:true
* `[` versus `[[` versus `$`
  * `$` works on lists (including data frames). Pulls out _one_ element (e.g. a vector)
  * `[[` works on anything: pulls out _one_ element (e.g. a vector)
  * `[` works on anything: pulls out _one or more_ elements, leaving them in their original container (e.g. a dataframe).

replicate
==================
incremental:true

```r
results = replicate(
  1000,
  mean(rnorm(10)) # Average of 10 standard normals
)
```

```r
sd(results) # Should be about sqrt(1/10)
```

```
[1] 0.3189
```

While
================
As long as some condition holds, keep doing stuff in braces.

```r
result = 2           # Start at 2
done = FALSE         # Task starts incomplete

while(!done){
  result = result^2 # Update result
  print(result)     # display result

  # See if we're done
  if(result > 100){done = TRUE}
}
```

```
[1] 4
[1] 16
[1] 256
```

For
===============
Do something for each element of x


```r
for(species in c("frog", "penguin", "rat")){
  new_name = paste0(toupper(species), "!")
  print(new_name)
}
```

```
[1] "FROG!"
[1] "PENGUIN!"
[1] "RAT!"
```

For
=================
Do something for each element of x


```r
for(species in unique(finch$Aou)){
  # Make one of these plots
}
```

*apply
==================
S-apply (simplified-apply) does something to each element of your data set and returns a simplified result (e.g. a vector or matrix)


```r
sapply(biomass_df, mean)
```

```
   site    bugs   flies beetles 
     NA    7.52   16.56    8.80 
```

Vector operations are faster than loops

Model formulas
==================
**?formula**

* Formulas are **not** normal R code
* Variables included in the model are separated by "+"
* `a * b` means to include a, b, and their interaction
* Can "inhibit" formula interpretation with the `I` function
